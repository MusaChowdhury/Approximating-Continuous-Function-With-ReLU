# Approximating continuous function with ReLU
The notebook 'ReLU's Function Approximation' demonstrates how multiple stacked ReLUs can approximate any continuous function.  
The demonstration is visualized in the most comprehensive way possible.  
The notebook can be found in the root repository directory.  
Thank you.
